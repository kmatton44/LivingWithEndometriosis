# LivingWithEndometriosis

This is a health app targeted towards women who have endometriosis that lets users sign up with their own account through a database that allows them to set their own profile image and profile username. Along with every account, there are daily remedies that are updated and reset every single day when the user logs into the app, allowing a sense of constant daily accomplishment when they're able to routinely complete them.

In the near future, I am working on making this app social-media(ish) where users from across the world will be able to talk with one another inside of the community tab, as well as work on other updates that pertain to a healthy physical and mental lifestyle!

There are half of a thousand downloads with LivingWithEndometriosis and continues to grow weekly!
